# Stakeholder Map Project

An investigation of the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Sciences (CSS) landscape in South Africa

The South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR) is a national centre supported by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) as part of the South African Research Infrastructure Roadmap (SARIR). SADiLaR has an enabling function, with a focus on all official languages of South Africa, supporting research and development in the domains of language technologies and language-related studies in the humanities and social sciences. Furthermore the centre has a mandate to develop digital humanities capacity in South Africa.

The stakeholder map project aims to collect and share data on Digital Humanities (DH), Computational Social Sciences (CSS) and related activities and initiatives in South Africa. The aim is to provide deeper insight into the breadth of activities in this area, facilitate enhanced networking and collaboration, and support the optimal use of resources.
